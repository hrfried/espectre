## [1.4.1] unreleased

### 🧬 Added - NBVI Automatic Subcarrier Selection

**Zero-configuration subcarrier optimization achieving F1=97.1%**

Implemented NBVI (Normalized Baseline Variability Index) algorithm for automatic subcarrier selection in both micro-espectre (Python) and espectre (C).

**Algorithm:**
- Formula: `NBVI = 0.3 × (σ/μ²) + 0.7 × (σ/μ)` (lower = better)
- Percentile-based baseline detection (p10, NO threshold needed)
- Noise Gate: excludes weak subcarriers (below 10th percentile)
- Spectral spacing: Top 5 + Δf≥3 for remaining 7

**Performance:**
- Pure data: F1=97.1% (gap to manual: -0.2%)
- Mixed data: F1=91.2% (4/4 calibrated)
- vs Variance-only: +4.7% (pure), ∞ (variance fails on mixed)

**Implementation:**
- Python: `src/nbvi_calibrator.py` (percentile-based only)
- C: `main/nbvi_calibrator.c/h` (same algorithm)
- Auto-calibration at boot if no saved configurationgit 
- Re-calibration after factory_reset command
- Memory: 128KB buffer (500 packets × 64 subcarriers)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Zero configuration required
- ✅ Adapts to any environment automatically
- ✅ Near-optimal performance (-0.2% gap to manual)
- ✅ Production-ready (validated on 1000+ packets)

**MicroPython Contribution:**
The MicroPython implementation (Micro-ESPectre) proved invaluable for rapid prototyping and parameter tuning. The ability to quickly test configurations and algorithms in Python accelerated the optimization process, with successful patterns then being ported back to the C firmware with confidence.

### 🚀 Enhanced - Traffic Generator Rate Limit

Increased maximum rate from 50 to 1000 pps for high-frequency motion detection:

- **Max rate**: 1000 pps (was 50 pps)
- **Default rate**: 100 pps (was 20 pps)
- **Nyquist-Shannon support**: Enables detection from vital signs (10-30 Hz) to fast motion (600-1000 Hz)
- Consistent across ESP32 and MicroPython platforms

### 🔧 Changed - Feature Extraction Always Active

Modified feature extraction behavior to be always active when enabled, regardless of segmentation state:

**Previous behavior:**
- Features extracted only during MOTION state
- IDLE state published without features

**New behavior:**
- Features extracted continuously when `features_enabled=true`
- Features published in both IDLE and MOTION states
- Provides continuous data stream for analysis and ML applications

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Continuous feature data for machine learning dataset collection
- ✅ Better baseline characterization during IDLE periods

### 🔄 Migrated - ESPectre CLI to Python

Rewrote CLI from Bash to Python for cross-platform support:

- **Modern UI**: Interactive prompt with autocompletion and syntax highlighting
- **Pure Python**: Uses `paho-mqtt` instead of external `mosquitto_pub/sub`

### 🎵 Added - Wi-Fi Theremin Sonification

Real-time audio sonification of CSI data via `espectre-theremin.html`:

- **Three modes**: Continuous, Quantized, Hybrid
- **10 CSI features** modulate audio parameters (waveform, vibrato, filter, pan, tremolo)
- **60Hz interpolation** for smooth audio between MQTT updates
- Web Audio API, single HTML file, no dependencies

### 🗑️ Removed - Redundant Segmentation Parameters

**Simplified segmentation: Removed redundant min_length, max_length, k_factor parameter**

After analysis of the segmentation algorithm, removed the `min_length` parameter as it was redundant with the moving variance window:

Removed redundant `k_factor` multiplier - users can now adjust threshold directly.
- Inittially introduced as a scale factor for threshold.

Removed `min_segment_length` parameter to simplify segmentation configuration:
- When moving variance exceeds threshold, it means the window already contains enough "motion packets"

Removed `max_segment_length` parameter to simplify segmentation configuration:
- Motion segments naturally end when movement stops (moving variance drops below threshold).

## [1.3.0] - 2025-11-22

### 🚀 ESP32-C6 Platform Support

**Complete multi-platform support with ESP32-C6 and WiFi 6**

Added comprehensive support for ESP32-C6 alongside ESP32-S3, enabling WiFi 6 (802.11ax):

### 🚀 Major - Amplitude-Based Skewness & Kurtosis

**Performance breakthrough: +151% separation improvement**

Based on analysis of 6 scientific papers on Wi-Fi CSI sensing, implemented amplitude-based approach for skewness and kurtosis:

- **Amplitude-based pipeline**:
  1. Convert raw bytes (I+jQ) → amplitude |h| = √(I² + Q²) for each subcarrier
  2. Aggregate all subcarriers → single amplitude value per packet
  3. Maintain 20-packet circular buffer for temporal analysis
  4. Calculate statistical moments (m2, m3, m4) on amplitude time series
  
- **Shared buffer optimization**:
  * Skewness and kurtosis share same `amplitude_moments_buffer`
  * Cached moments (m2, m4) reused between features
  * Zero memory overhead, ~5% CPU overhead
  
- **Results**:

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Reliable CSI packet generation on every ping reply
- ✅ No external dependencies (uses gateway)
- ✅ Simpler code (~200 lines vs manual ICMP implementation)
- ✅ Better error handling and logging

**Technical details:**
- Previous: UDP broadcast (no reply, unreliable CSI generation)
- Current: ICMP ping to gateway (bidirectional, reliable CSI on reply)
- Configurable rate: 1-50 pps
- Automatic gateway IP discovery from network interface

### 🚀 Improved - CSI Subcarrier Optimization

**Maximum spatial information: Reading ALL available subcarriers**

Based on ESP32-S3 Wi-Fi documentation analysis, optimized CSI data collection to capture complete channel information:

- **Channel filter disabled**: Changed `channel_filter_en` from `true` to `false`
  * Now receives ALL 64 subcarriers instead of 52 (+23% spatial information)
  * Includes edge subcarriers (-32 to -27 and +27 to +32) previously filtered
  * More complete frequency response of the channel
  
**Benefits:**
- ✅ +23% more spatial information (64 vs 52 subcarriers)
- ✅ Better movement detection accuracy
- ✅ More data for calibration optimization
- ✅ Higher spatial resolution

### ✨ Added - Temporal Features

**Enhanced feature set: Expanded from 8 to 10 features**

- **New temporal features**: Added 2 temporal features that track changes between consecutive CSI packets
  - `temporal_delta_mean`: Average absolute difference from previous packet
  - `temporal_delta_variance`: Variance of differences from previous packet
- **Improved detection**: Temporal features capture movement dynamics over time
- **Backward compatible**: Existing calibrations continue to work with the expanded feature set

**Feature set now includes:**
- **Statistical** (5): variance, skewness, kurtosis, entropy, iqr
- **Spatial** (3): spatial_variance, spatial_correlation, spatial_gradient
- **Temporal** (2): temporal_delta_mean, temporal_delta_variance

### 🔧 Changed - Modified Fisher Criterion

**Improved feature selection algorithm**

- **Modified Fisher Score**: Changed from standard Fisher `(μ₁ - μ₂)² / (σ₁² + σ₂²)` to Modified Fisher `(μ₁ - μ₂)² / √(σ₁² + σ₂²)`
- **Pre-normalization**: All features normalized to [0,1] before Fisher calculation
  * Eliminates bias towards features with large absolute values
  * Ensures fair comparison between features
  * Skewness/kurtosis now correctly selected as top features
- **Benefits**: 
  - Less penalty for features with high variance
  - Better selection of features with strong signal separation
  - More robust in noisy environments
- **Configurable**: Can be toggled via `USE_MODIFIED_FISHER` flag in `calibration.c`

### 🧪 Added - Local Segmentation Test Script

**Python tool for rapid parameter tuning without device flashing**

- **test_segmentation_local.py**: Replicates ESP32 segmentation algorithm locally
  * Implements Moving Variance Segmentation (MVS) with adaptive threshold
  * Calculates spatial turbulence from CSI packets
  * Extracts statistical features from motion segments
  * Includes Random Forest classifier for validation
  * Interactive visualization of segmentation results

**Features:**
- **Parameter optimization**: Grid search over 300 combinations (--optimize flag)
- **Configurable parameters**: WINDOW_SIZE, MIN_SEGMENT, MAX_SEGMENT at top of file
- **Batch mode**: Skip visualization with --no-plot flag
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Usage examples and parameter descriptions

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Fast iteration without ESP32 flashing
- ✅ Visual feedback for parameter tuning
- ✅ Automatic optimal parameter discovery
- ✅ Validates C code implementation in Python

**Usage:**
```bash
python test_app/test_segmentation_local.py              # Run with defaults
python test_app/test_segmentation_local.py --optimize   # Find optimal parameters
python test_app/test_segmentation_local.py --no-plot    # Skip visualization
```

### ✨ Added - CSI Raw Data Collection

**Dataset generation for testing and analysis**
- **Calibration data export**: Extended `calibrate` command to print CSI raw data during calibration

**Usage:**
```bash
espectre> calibrate start 100 verbose
```

### 🗑️ Removed - Adaptive Normalizer

**Code simplification: Removed adaptive normalizer filter**

The adaptive normalizer has been removed to simplify the codebase and reduce computational overhead:

- **Simplified filter pipeline**:
  ```
  Butterworth (ON) → Wavelet (OFF) → Hampel (OFF) → Savitzky-Golay (ON)
  ```
**Rationale:**
The adaptive normalizer was primarily used for monitoring/debugging and did not directly affect signal processing or motion detection. Its removal simplifies the system while maintaining all core functionality.
