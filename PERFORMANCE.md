# 🛜 ESPectre 👻 - Performance Metrics

This document provides detailed performance metrics for ESPectre's motion detection system based on Moving Variance Segmentation (MVS).

## Test Methodology

### Test Data
- **Baseline packets**: 1000 CSI packets captured during idle state (no movement)
- **Movement packets**: 1000 CSI packets captured during active movement
- **Total**: 2000 packets
- **Packet Rate**: 100 packets/second

### Configuration
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Window Size | 50 packets |
| Threshold | 1.0 |
| Subcarriers | [11-22] (12 subcarriers) |

### Test Environment
- **Platform**: ESP32-C6
- **Distance from router**: ~3 meters
- **Environment**: Indoor residential

## Confusion Matrix

```
CONFUSION MATRIX (1000 baseline + 1000 movement packets):
                    Predicted
                IDLE        MOTION
Actual IDLE     1000 (TN)   0 (FP)
Actual MOTION   19 (FN)     981 (TP)
```

### Metrics Breakdown

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Recall** | 98.1% | >90% | ✅ |
| **Precision** | 100.0% | - | ✅ |
| **FP Rate** | 0.0% | <10% | ✅ |
| **F1-Score** | 99.0% | - | ✅ |

### Detailed Counts
| Metric | Count | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| True Positives (TP) | 981 | Movement correctly detected |
| True Negatives (TN) | 1000 | Idle correctly identified |
| False Positives (FP) | 0 | No false alarms |
| False Negatives (FN) | 19 | Missed movement detections |

## Interpretation

### Strengths
- **Zero false positives**: The system never triggers false alarms during idle periods
- **High recall (98.1%)**: Detects 98.1% of all movement events
- **Perfect precision**: When motion is reported, it's always real motion

### False Negatives Analysis
The 19 false negatives (1.9% of movement packets) are typically caused by:
1. **Transition periods**: Packets at the very start/end of movement sequences
2. **Micro-movements**: Very subtle movements that don't exceed the threshold
3. **Buffer warm-up**: First few packets after state transitions

These missed detections are acceptable for most use cases (home automation, presence detection) where brief detection gaps don't impact functionality.

## How to Verify Performance

### Monitor Detection in Real-Time

```bash
# View ESPHome logs
esphome logs espectre.yaml
```

Watch for state transitions:
- `state=MOTION` when movement occurs
- `state=IDLE` when room is quiet

### Home Assistant History

Use Home Assistant's History panel to visualize:
- **binary_sensor.espectre_motion_detected** - Motion events over time
- **sensor.espectre_movement_score** - Movement intensity graph

### Collecting Test Data

For rigorous testing, you can:
1. Record baseline period (no movement) for 10+ seconds
2. Record movement period (walking, gestures) for 10+ seconds
3. Compare detection accuracy against ground truth

## Performance Targets

ESPectre is designed for **security and presence detection** applications where:

| Priority | Metric | Target | Rationale |
|----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **High** | Recall | >90% | Minimize missed detections |
| **High** | FP Rate | <10% | Avoid false alarms |
| **Medium** | Precision | >90% | Ensure reported motion is real |
| **Medium** | F1-Score | >90% | Balance precision and recall |

The current configuration exceeds all targets.

## Tuning for Your Environment

Real performances may vary based on:
- **Distance from router**: Optimal 3-8 meters
- **Room layout**: Open spaces vs. cluttered rooms
- **Wall materials**: Drywall vs. concrete
- **Interference**: Other Wi-Fi devices, microwave ovens

See [TUNING.md](TUNING.md) for detailed tuning instructions.
